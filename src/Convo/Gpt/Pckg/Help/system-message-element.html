    <h3>System Message</h3>

    <p>
        The System Message element defines a system-generated message within the chat context. These messages are primarily used in conjunction with the <strong>GPT Chat Completion API v2</strong> to prepend system-level information or context to a conversation. This can be useful for providing agents with a consistent introduction or setting the tone for the conversation.

    <h3>Message Content</h3>
    <p>
        This field allows you to specify the text content of the system message. The content can be static or dynamically generated based on the flow.
