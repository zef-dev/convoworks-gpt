    <h3>GPT Query Generator</h3>

    <p>
        The GPT Query Generator element allows you to create context-rich questions from a given conversation. These questions can be utilized to query a knowledge database, enhancing GPT chat completion-based interactions by providing additional context and insights. 
    </p>

    <h3>System Message</h3>
    <p>
        A predetermined prompt that sets the initial context and format for the conversation. This message provides the GPT with a structure to follow when generating questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Messages</h3>
    <p>
        An array of messages that represent the conversation from the GPT chat completion. This serves as the primary context from which the GPT generates the questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Messages Count</h3>
    <p>
        Specifies the number of recent messages from the conversation that should be considered for generating questions. This allows for flexibility in narrowing down or expanding the conversation context.
    </p>

    <h3>Result Variable Name</h3>
    <p>
        The variable that will store the generated questions. This makes it possible to reference and utilize the generated questions in subsequent operations or outputs.
    </p>

    <h3>API Options</h3>
    <p>
        Specific parameters for the GPT chat completion API. This section allows you to fine-tune the behavior of the question generation process. Options include choosing the specific GPT model, setting the temperature, and limiting the maximum tokens.
    </p>

    <h3>OK Flow</h3>
    <p>
        The sequence of elements that will be executed after successful question generation. This can include subsequent operations or responses that utilize the generated questions to enhance the overall conversation flow.
    </p>
