    <h3>Autonomous Chat Element</h3>

    <p>
        This element enables you to create chat application which will be able to autonomously execute defined actions on your website.
        <br>
        This element uses completion API.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Conversation</h3>
    <p>
        There are three roles in this conversation. Except <b>Bot</b> and <b>User</b> we have a <b>Website</b> agent whcih is able to execute actions.
        <br>
        When the user requests some action, the Bot will respond with plain JSON, stating within which action is requested and passing along all requested params. 
        Chat element will recognize that as the action request, will trigger appropriate action (matched by action_id) and pass the result to the conversation. 
        After that new completion is requested.
        <br>
        Conversation itself (all messages) is handled by the client (service).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Prompt building</h3>
    <p>
        Prompt consists of two parts.
        <br>
        The first part are instructions and the chat definition. It is built using the element's <b>Main prompt</b> and prompts defined by the child Prompt elements.
        <br>
        The second part is the current conversation.
        <br>
        While building the Prompts section, you can use IF/ELSE and other control structures, allowing you to dynamicaly change conversation context.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p>
        Actions are specialized elements, defined with action_id, which are able to execute elements and return result.
        <br>
        Like with Prompts, here you can also use control structures to dynamicaly disable or modify defined actions.
    </p>

    <h3>Result variable</h3>
    <ul style="padding-left: 15px; list-style: disc;">
        <li><b>messages</b> array, all messages in the conversation (without system message)</li>
        <li><b>bot_response</b> string, actual bot response</li>
        <li><b>last_prompt</b> string, full system message</li>
    </ul>
