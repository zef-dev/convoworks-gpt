    <h3>Simple Prompt Element</h3>

    <p>
        This element allows you to split a complex prompt into several, manageable sections. 
        Prompts are generated as markdown and the hedings are automatically generated from titles (number of # infront of the prompt title) 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can use this element inside IF/ELSE blocks allowing you to dynamically turn them on and off. 
        You can also use expressions inside prompt content, enabling you to insert dynamic data (e.g. current date)
